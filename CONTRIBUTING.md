# Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in Smashing! This project is a fork of Dashing, the exceptionally handsome dashboard framework. We're still in the process of transitioning, so please excuse the mess.

For general questions on new features, widgets, or ideas, please consider using the
[Gitter Chat Room](https://gitter.im/Smashing/Lobby). This way
developers can maintain code-related issues in GitHub, and help users with users with simple
usage or widgets questions in a more appropriate channel.

## Have an Issue

If you run into problems with Smashing (or Dashing), please take these steps before
submitting an issue:

1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/Dashing-io/dashing/wiki#how-tos) in the wiki.
2. Use the [GitHub Issue Search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) to check if the issue has already been reported.
3. Submit your issue to our Issue Tracker. Please provide as much helpful information as possible, preferably making use of a [reduced test case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Reducing_testcases).

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome, but take a moment to consider whether your idea
fits with the scope and aim of the project. A good rule of thumb is to apply
the 80/20 rule: every feature should be useful to at least 80% of users. Adding
in every possible edge case will only make it more difficult to understand, maintain,
and hack on.

If you feel that you have a really amazing, super neato idea that doesn't
quite fit with the core use of Smashing, it may be a good candidate for an
external Gem which supercharges a project. An excellent example of this is
[dashing-contrib](https://github.com/QubitProducts/dashing-contrib). If you
do create a third-party extension for Smashing, please add it [here](https://github.com/Dashing-io/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets#other-third-party-tools).

For general questions on new features, widgets, or ideas, please use the
[project mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/smashing-dashboard).

## Pull Requests

Patches, improvements and new features are a fantastic
help -- thank you!

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that may
not be merged into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).
All code submitted via Pull Request will be dicussed and critiqued in a
respectful manner.

GitHub has [excellent documentation on how to use Pull Requests.](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
